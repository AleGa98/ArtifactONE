# UIKit in SwiftUI and vice versa
In this repository I show how to implement a nonModalView in swiftUI  and also how to implement a swiftUIView in a containerView thanks to UIkit

For this project I used : 
- UIKit
- SwiftUI

It is divided in two section :
1. I create a non-modal button to reclaim a half sheet  _(UIKit in SwiftUI)_
2. In this half sheet I put a containerView that hosting a SwiftUI View  _(SwiftUI in UIKit)_
